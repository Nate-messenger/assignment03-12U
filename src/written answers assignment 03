question 1

function     Big-O 

2n           n^2
3n+51        n^3
100          1
5n3+5n-10    n^3
3log5n       log n 


question 2

the max amount of comparisons would be 4 because the array has to be sorted and it only needs to compare the numbers to the left or right and the middle

question 3

O(n) because it depends on the size of the array 

question 4

if the arrays are sorted then one will run faster

question 5 
the theoretical best run time is o(1)
